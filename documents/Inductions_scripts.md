## Mindfulness

*aka Explicit Attentional Instruction*

### Expectations

You are about to receive instructions aimed at enhancing your focus and directing your inner awareness.

### Posture Preparation

Begin by finding a comfortable seated position and placing your hands gently on the desk. Allow your shoulders to relax, and firmly ground your feet.
Gently close your eyes and direct your attention solely to following the guidance to reach a state of ***relaxation***.
Inhale and exhale slowly, letting your body settle into this state of ***meditation***.

### Mental State Induction

For the next few breaths bring your full focus of attention to your breathing.
Notice the feeling of the air flowing in through the nostrils, down into the lungs, and down into the belly as you inhale.
On the exhale, feel the release of any tension as you let the air out slowly.
Now, imagine that you are sitting by the side of a gently flowing stream.
This might be a stream that you know, or it might be something you create in your mind using your imagination.
There might be a light breeze blowing as you sit here, dappled light glistening on
the water, and soft green grass beneath you... imagine the stream however you like – it's your imagination.
Now imagine that there are leaves floating on the surface of the stream, and these leaves are gently flowing past you, down the stream.
For the next few minutes, see if you can take every thought that pops into your head and place it on a leaf.
Your thoughts may show up in your mind in the form of words, pictures, or something else.
However if a thought arises, simply place it on a leaf and let it float by.
Do this regardless of whether the thoughts are positive and enjoyable or negative and challenging.
Simply place each on a leaf and let it float down the stream.
If you notice that your thoughts stop momentarily, just continue to watch the stream.
Sooner or later, your thoughts will start up again. Allow the stream to flow at its own rate.
There is no need to try and speed it up.
The aim here is not to wash the leaves away – the aim is to allow them to come and go in their own time.
Just sit and watch.

### Reinforcement

If your mind says something along the lines of "I can't do it" or "This is stupid," place those thoughts on leaves and let them float by.
If a leaf gets stuck, let it hang around. There is no need to force it to float away.
Simply sit and watch as sooner or later another leaf will come along and give it the nudge it needs.
If a difficult feeling arises, such as boredom, impatience, or anxiety, simply acknowledge it.
Say to yourself "Here is a feeling of boredom," "Here is a feeling of impatience," "Here is a feeling of anxiety," and place those words on a leaf.
Now from time to time, your thoughts will hook you, and you will lose track of the exercise.
This is normal as our attention naturally wanders, and it will happen time and time again.
As soon as you realize this has happened, simply come back to your stream.

### Preparation for upcoming task

Continue this practice, placing each thought on a leaf and allowing it to drift away.
Much like observing visual illusions, acknowledge the presence of thoughts without clinging to them.
Just as you choose to release biasing black elements in the illusions, choose to let go of thoughts that attempt to hold you.
In this process, you will perceive what is present.
Focus on your intention, which is to see through the illusion and its black biasing components, to
see the truth of the red elements underneath.

### State exit

Your thoughts may still distract you at times, and that's perfectly normal.
Each time you notice, guide your attention back to the stream.
As this exercise concludes, gradually release the imagery of the stream and reorient your awareness to your surroundings.
Notice sounds, sensations, and, when you're ready, open your eyes to the visual world.
You might want to pause for a moment before continuing with your day, carrying this sense of presence forward.

## Hypnosis

### Expectations

You are going to listen to instructions designed at helping you reach a state of heightened focus and ability to direct your mind.

### Posture Preparation

Find a comfortable seated position, resting your hands on the desk. Let your shoulders relax as you ground your feet.
Close your eyes, and let your entire focus rest on my calming voice.
Take slow, calming breaths, inviting your body to sink into a state of profound ***ease and comfort***

### Mental State Induction

As my words flow, you will naturally enter a tranquil state of hypnosis.
Your presence here indicates your eagerness to embrace the journey of hypnosis.
Hypnosis is a natural process; follow my guidance and absorb my words.
Relaxation will effortlessly envelop you as you embrace the ideas I present.
This experience is entirely safe and soothing.
If your thoughts wander, gently bring them back to my words to deepen your hypnotic state.
As you think of relaxation, feel the soothing waves of calmness spreading through your body.
Starting with your right foot, release the tension in your leg.
Now, your left leg.
Let relaxation cascade throughout your body.
Relax your right hand, forearm, upper arm, and shoulder. Feel the tension melt away.
Now your left hand, forearm, upper arm, and shoulder.
Ease permeates your neck and chest.
You are now profoundly relaxed.

### Reinforcement

With each passing moment, a sense of deep tranquility will anchor within you, gently enveloping your limbs.
A comforting heaviness will flow through your legs, hands, and arms, cocooning your being in serenity.
You are deeply at ease, and with every word I utter, this tranquility will deepen.
As I count, you'll sink even further into a transcendental hypnotic state, yet remain open to following my instructions without awakening.

You are undisturbed... five... six... deeply immersed in hypnosis, my voice clear in your mind.

Deeply hypnotized, and you will stay this way until I guide you otherwise.
You'll remain relaxed, hypnotized, and receptive to my descriptions.

### Preparation for Upcoming Task

Although deeply relaxed and hypnotized, you will retain the ability to write, move, and open your eyes, all while remaining undisturbed and just as comfortable.
You are in complete control of your experience.
Now, as we return to the visual illusion tasks, keep this relaxed state easily accessible.
Pay closer attention to the elements that bias the illusion.
Just as you've chosen to embrace this relaxation, you can effortlessly choose to ignore the black components in the tasks, focusing instead on the red elements.
This process will be simple and stress-free, and if your focus drifts, you can easily return to this state by re-centering your attention on my voice.

### State Exit

Now, as you continue with the visual illusion tasks, remember that drifting in and out is natural.
Returning to this serene state is as effortless as drifting away.
Counting from one to five, you'll reawaken to proceed, carrying this relaxation with you. seeing
past the illusion's biasing elements and perceiving the truth of the red elements underneath.
One... take a deep breath... Two... heightened awareness and refreshment... Three... enveloped in calmness... Four... ready to proceed... Five... open your eyes, maintaining relaxation and focus.
