## Mindfulness

*aka Explicit Attentional Instruction*

### Expectations

You are going to listen to instructions designed at helping you reach a state of heightened focus and ability to direct your mind.

### Posture Preparation

Now, please find a comfortable seated position, and rest your hands gently on the desk. Allow your shoulders to drop and relax, and plant your feet firmly on the ground.
Close your eyes and focus solely on ***following the instructions***.
Take slow, easy breaths, allowing your body to settle into this state of ***meditation***.

### Mental State Induction

For the next few breaths bring your full focus of attention to your breathing.
Notice the feeling of the air flowing in through the nostrils, down into the lungs, and down into the belly as you inhale.
On the exhale, feel the release of any tension as you let the air out slowly.
Now, imagine that you are sitting by the side of a gently flowing stream.
This might be a stream that you know, or it might be something you create in your mind using your imagination.
There might be a light breeze blowing as you sit here, dappled light glistening on
the water, and soft green grass beneath you... imagine the stream however you like – it's your imagination.
Now imagine that there are leaves floating on the surface of the stream, and these leaves are gently flowing past you, down the stream.
For the next few minutes, see if you can take every thought that pops into your head and place it on a leaf.
Your thoughts may show up in your mind in the form of words, pictures, or something else.
However if a thought arises, simply place it on a leaf and let it float by.
Do this regardless of whether the thoughts are positive and enjoyable or negative and challenging.
Simply place each on a leaf and let it float down the stream.
If you notice that your thoughts stop momentarily, just continue to watch the stream.
Sooner or later, your thoughts will start up again. Allow the stream to flow at its own rate.
There is no need to try and speed it up.
The aim here is not to wash the leaves away – the aim is to allow them to come and go in their own time.
Just sit and watch.

### Reinforcement

If your mind says something along the lines of "I can't do it" or "This is stupid," place those thoughts on leaves and let them float by.
If a leaf gets stuck, let it hang around. There is no need to force it to float away.
Simply sit and watch as sooner or later another leaf will come along and give it the nudge it needs.
If a difficult feeling arises, such as boredom, impatience, or anxiety, simply acknowledge it.
Say to yourself "Here is a feeling of boredom," "Here is a feeling of impatience," "Here is a feeling of anxiety," and place those words on a leaf.
Now from time to time, your thoughts will hook you, and you will lose track of the exercise.
This is normal as our attention naturally wanders, and it will happen time and time again.
As soon as you realize this has happened, simply come back to your stream.



### Preparation for upcoming task

Continuing to place each thought that pops into your mind on a leaf and watching it slip by.
Much like the visual illusions you saw before this mindfulness session, we can know something is there, and instead of holding on to it, just simply choose to let it go.
When thoughts come up, we can quell this movement and return to a state of peace that we choose and carve out ourselves.
Much the same can be done when seeing visual illusions.
When you return to the tasks later, you may find it easy to ignore the biasing red components, choosing to let them wash over you and go, accepting them and letting go, much like thoughts that may try to hold you.
Through this, you can see what is there.
By focusing on what you want to do, which is see through the illusion and its biasing red elements.

### State exit

Again and again, your thoughts will hook you.
Remember, this is normal.
As soon as you notice this has happened, simply come back to your stream.
As the exercise comes to an end, begin to let go of your imagined stream and bring your attention back to where you are.
Notice what you can hear, what you can feel, and when you're ready, open your eyes and notice what you can see.
You might like to take another minute to sit quietly before carrying on with your day, holding on to this sense of presence and spaciousness from thinking.

## Hypnosis

### Expectations

You are going to listen to instructions designed at helping you reach a state of heightened focus and ability to direct your mind.

### Posture Preparation

Now, please find a comfortable seated position, and rest your hands gently on the desk. Allow your shoulders to drop and relax, and plant your feet firmly on the ground.
Close your eyes and focus solely on my soothing voice.
Take slow, easy breaths, allowing your body to settle into this state of ***relaxation***.


### Mental State Induction

As you listen to my words, you will gradually enter a peaceful state of hypnosis.
Your willingness to be here today indicates your desire to experience all that this hypnotic journey offers.
Hypnosis is a natural process, and all you need to do is follow my guidance and concentrate on my words.
Relaxation will come effortlessly as you embrace the ideas I present.
There's nothing to fear; this experience is entirely safe and comfortable.
If your thoughts wander, that's alright; simply refocus on my words, and you will easily slip deeper into hypnosis.
As you think of relaxing, your muscles will begin to relax. Starting with your right foot, relax the muscles of your right leg.
Now the muscles of your left leg.
Just relax all over.
Relax your right hand... your forearm... upper arm... and shoulder... That's right.
Now your left hand... and forearm... and upper arm... and shoulder.
Relax your neck and chest.
More and more relaxed... completely relaxed.


### Reinforcement

With each passing moment, you'll feel your body becoming deeply at ease, comfortably sinking into the chair.
A pleasant feeling of heaviness and comfort will flow through your legs, hands, and arms, enveloping your entire being.
You are now deeply relaxed, and with every word I utter, you will feel even more tranquil.
As I count, you will feel yourself going down further and further into a deeply relaxed, a deeply hypnotized state, but you will be able to do all sorts of things I ask you to do without waking up... One... you are going to become more deeply relaxed and hypnotized... Two... down, down deeper, and deeper... Three... Four... you are sinking deeper and deeper into hypnosis.
Nothing will disturb you... five... six... although deeply hypnotized, you can hear me clearly.
You will always hear me distinctly no matter how deeply hypnotized you become... Seven... Eight... deeply hypnotized.
Nothing will disturb you.
You are going to experience many things that I will tell you to experience... Nine... Ten.
Deeply hypnotized now! You will remain hypnotized until I tell you otherwise.
You will wish to remain relaxed and hypnotized and to have the experiences I describe to you.

### Preparation for Upcoming Task

Although deeply relaxed and hypnotized, you will retain the ability to write, move, and open your eyes, all while remaining undisturbed and just as comfortable.
You are in complete control of your experience.
Now, as we return to the visual illusion tasks, keep this relaxed state easily accessible.
Pay closer attention to the elements that bias the illusion.
Just as you've chosen to embrace this relaxation, you can effortlessly choose to ignore the red components in the tasks, focusing instead on the black elements.
This process will be simple and stress-free, and if your focus drifts, you can easily return to this state by re-centering your attention on my voice.

### State Exit

I'll now leave you to continue with the visual illusion tasks, but before that, let's reinforce this hypnotic state.
Remember, drifting in and out is natural, and returning to this relaxed state is just as easy as drifting away.
Now, I'll count from one to five.
When I reach five, you can open your eyes and continue with the tasks, maintaining this state of deep relaxation, while effortlessly ignoring any red components you encounter.
One... take a deep breath... Two... feeling more refreshed and aware... Three... a sense of calmness surrounding you... Four... becoming more alert and ready to proceed... Five... open your eyes and continue, feeling relaxed and focused.
