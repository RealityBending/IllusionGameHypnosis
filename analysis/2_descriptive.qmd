## Descriptive Statistics


```{r}

```


## Induction Effect 

### Subjective

```{r}
dfsub |> 
  select(participant_id, starts_with("Induction")) |> 
  pivot_longer(-participant_id) |> 
  mutate(label = case_when(
    name == "Induction_Q1" ~ "Did you follow the audio instructions?",
    name == "Induction_Q2" ~ "Do you feel like you were in a different    mental state at the end of the audio instructions?",
    name == "Induction_Q3" ~ "Do you feel like you could remain in this state when the illusion game began?",
    name == "Induction_Q4" ~ "Do you feel like you were (still) in a different mental state throughout most of the illusion game?",
    TRUE ~ "In general, do you feel like your performance (as compared to the first time) at the illusion game was impacted by the instructions?"
  )) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = label, fill = participant_id)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 1))
```

### Objective

```{r}
errors <- df |> 
  filter(Illusion_Effect == "Incongruent") |> 
  group_by(participant_id, Condition, Illusion_Type) |> 
  summarise(Error = mean(Error))

errors |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Condition, y = Error, color=participant_id)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = participant_id)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(~Illusion_Type)
```
