```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
```

## 

```{r data retrieve}
data <- read.csv("../data_IllusionGame.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
